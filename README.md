# Fake-News-Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on identifying and classifying fake news using natural language processing (NLP) and data mining techniques. The goal is to build a machine learning model capable of detecting misinformation from textual content.

## About the Dataset

Fake news poses significant threats to society by spreading misinformation. The dataset contains labeled articles and news texts, categorized as real or fake.

## Purpose
To classify news articles into fake or real categories, thereby addressing misinformation using automated techniques.

## Contents
* Data Exploration: Investigate common patterns and text features associated with fake and real news. Visualize word frequencies and article characteristics.
* Data Preprocessing: Clean text data (e.g., remove punctuation, stopwords, and apply stemming/lemmatization). Transform text into numerical representations using TF-IDF or word embeddings.
* Model Building: Implement machine learning classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Random Forests. Explore advanced NLP techniques like transformers for improved accuracy.
* Evaluation: Measure model performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Insights: Highlight patterns in fake vs. real news articles.

## Technologies Used
* Python: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
* Text Representation: TF-IDF, Count Vectorizer.
* Notebook Platform: Google Colab.
